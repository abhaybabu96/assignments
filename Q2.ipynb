    "# Abstraction\n",
    "# Abstraction in OOP involves simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential aspects and hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "# It focuses on the behavior and functionality of objects rather than their implementation. Abstraction allows developers to create \n",
    "# abstract classes and interfaces that define a common interface for a set of related classes, promoting code reuse, modularity, and \n",
    "# encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An example of abstraction is a Shape class with different subclasses such as Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle.\n",
    "# The Shape class can define abstract methods like area() and perimeter() without specifying their implementation. \n",
    "# Each subclass then provides \n",
    "# its own implementation for these abstract methods. The abstract Shape class provides a\n",
    "# common interface that guarantees every subclass will have the required behavior, but the actual implementation details are \n",
    "# hidden within each subclass."
