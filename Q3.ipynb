    "# The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs are classes that define a common interface for a set of subclasses. They are used to define abstract methods and enforce a specific structure on subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The abc module is used to create abstract base classes by utilizing the ABC metaclass or the abstractmethod decorator. Here are a few use cases and benefits of using the abc module:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining interfaces: Abstract base classes allow you to define a common interface that multiple subclasses must adhere to. By defining abstract methods in the ABC, you can ensure that all subclasses implement those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enforcing structure: ABCs can define certain methods or properties that subclasses must implement. This helps in enforcing a specific structure or behavior across different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: Abstract base classes enable polymorphism by allowing different objects to be treated uniformly based on their common interface defined by the ABC.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Type checking: Abstract base classes can be used for type checking to ensure that objects passed to a function or method match the required interface defined by the ABC. This helps catch errors early during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Documentation and code readability: By using ABCs, you can provide clear documentation and communicate the expected structure and behavior of subclasses to other developers. This enhances code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To use the abc module, you typically define a class that inherits from ABC and use the @abstractmethod decorator to mark certain methods as abstract. Subclasses must implement these abstract methods to be considered valid."
